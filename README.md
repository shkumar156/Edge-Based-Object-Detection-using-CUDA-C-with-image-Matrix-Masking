# Edge-Based-Object-Detection-using-CUDA-C-with-image-Matrix-Masking
üìò Objective
To detect objects (edges) in an image using a 3√ó3 mask in CUDA C by converting the image to matrix form and processing each pixel in parallel using GPU threads.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
CUDA Toolkit (nvcc compiler)

C/C++ with NVIDIA extensions

BMP Image Format

Google Colab (for GPU access)

Python (for preprocessing/postprocessing)

üß† Working Principle
The input image is converted to grayscale using weighted RGB values.

A 3√ó3 Laplacian mask is applied to each pixel using a CUDA kernel.

Each thread processes one pixel and computes the convolution result.

The result is written back as a new image showing detected edges.

The output matrix can also be viewed to understand detection numerically.

üß™ Mask Used
Laplacian Edge Detection Mask:
[[-1, -1, -1],
 [-1,  8, -1],
 [-1, -1, -1]]
This highlights areas with high-intensity changes (edges of objects).

üßæ Steps
Upload image and convert to .bmp

Compile CUDA file with nvcc

Run executable with input and output filenames

Display or download the processed result
